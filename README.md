# Base16 Classic Dark

![Base16 Classic Dark](other/screenshot.png)

This is my personal take on the `Base16 Classic Dark` theme for Visual Studio Code. It is based on a `Base16 Classic Dark` color scheme I used for a long time for my terminal and neovim, but I never found a good theme for VS Code. So I decided to create, or rather port, one myself.
